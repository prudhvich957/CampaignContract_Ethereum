# CampaignContract_Ethereum

This is project simulates a function of the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform for various needs / projects. Here fundamentally, a user is able to create simple crowdfunding request for his/her project. This can hold multiple contributors to donation to the manager / user (creater of the smart contract). In order spend the donations a 'spending request' is made by the manager to the list of contributors, who then vote with a majority in order to approve for the request.

All of these functions are handled by a smart contract deployed an ethereum blockchain. Users are faced with a simple react frontend in React wrapped in NextJs and
utilizing Web3 to interact / integrate with smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
